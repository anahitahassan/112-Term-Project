# 112-TA-Simulator

# Description
    Welcome to 112 TA Simulator! Today you'll be the TA at office hours, helping out students. A part of your job is to prioritize students on the Office hour queue (OHQ), and to get to the student at the top of the OHQ, you must go through a maze. However, throughout the maze are enemy students who are not on the OHQ and they want to hunt you down to bug you with their questions. Your goal, as the TA, is to get to the OHQ student at the end of the maze as fast as possible without bumping into any enemy students in the maze.
